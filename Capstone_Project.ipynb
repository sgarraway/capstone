The success or failure of a new food related establishment may be strongly influenced by factors that are out of the control of the business operators or backers, such as the population demographics or the trends of an area. Fortunatly, today's entrepreneurs who are starting new ventures have more data and advanced analysis tools at their disposal than ever before.  When properly understood, assembled, preprocessed and transformed into visual representations, streams of publicly and privately available data can provide useful insights for important decisions. Machine learning also provides new ways to examine this data to make predictions and gain unseen insights. </p><p> The goal of my project is to gather available census and food venue data from sources through automated means, organize and preprocess this data to provide visual analytics for users, and finally training a machine learning polynoimal regression algorithm to make predections regarding choices of venue for a given location. For the purposes of this project, I will only be focusing on data for the Greater Victoria region of British Columbia, Canada</p>"
